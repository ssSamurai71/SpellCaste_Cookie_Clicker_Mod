# SpellCaster mod

This repository holds the code for my mod for cookie clicker.
It is a mod that automatically casts spells from the wizard tower mini game. 
It uses klattmose's Cookie Clicker Script Extender to make writing the mod easier. 
This means that Cookie Clicker Script Extender (CCSE) is needed to run it.
