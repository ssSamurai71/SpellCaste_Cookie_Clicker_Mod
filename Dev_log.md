#Day 1 Spetember 1st 2021
Started writing the script for my mod. Testing thing and getting the idea fleshed out.

#Day 2 Spetember 2nd 2021 - 5 Spetember 6th 2021 
Slowly building the mod up and understanding how CCSE works a bit more. I have the part of the menu working.
It displays the mod's full name but doesn't display the menu string. It also doesn't display the notification like Klattmose's mods do.
Currently working on fixing these things first before getting and displaying the spell price for a sanity check. Will ask for help later.
