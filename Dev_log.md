#Day 1 September 1st 2021
Started writing the script for my mod. Testing thing and getting the idea fleshed out.

#Day 2 September 2nd 2021 - 5 September 6th 2021 
Slowly building the mod up and understanding how CCSE works a bit more. I have the part of the menu working.
It displays the mod's full name but doesn't display the menu string. It also doesn't display the notification like Klattmose's mods do.
Currently working on fixing these things first before getting and displaying the spell price for a sanity check. Will ask for help later.

#Day 18 September 23 2021
Forgot about this dev log that I made. I got the menu working with it displaying all of the right text that I want.
There is currently one button working and another button that needs wotking on. I can currently cast the first spell in cookie clicker from the options menu. 
Right now I am currently working on trying to automate that spell call through another function and I have not yet figured it out yet.

#Day 23 September 28 2021
Finished the base MVP of the mod. It can now cast each spell on a set interval to allow the player to idle freely. They can enable the 1st spell just for cookies. Reserrect abomination can be auto cast if needed but probably will do nothing for the player but its there. The rest of the spells are set to go after dimish ineptitude. Example: diminish inpetititude then summon crafty pixies.

Will work on the mod eventually but for now it is just some clean up and optimizations.
